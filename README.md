# Captcha Generator ðŸ¤–

The CAPTCHA Generator Project is a simple web application built using Flask and the Python Imaging Library (PIL). The application generates a CAPTCHA image with random text that users must enter correctly to pass verification. This project helps prevent automated bots from interacting with your web application by ensuring that only humans can pass the CAPTCHA test.



## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x

- Flask

- PIL (Pillow)


```bash
pip install flask pillow
```
## Project Structure
Here's a breakdown of the project files:


```bash
captcha-generator/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                   # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html           # HTML template for rendering the CAPTCHA
â””â”€â”€ README.md                # Project documentation (this file)

```

## Setup and Installation

- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Create and activate virtual environment,
- Install required dependencies.
- Run the app.

```bash
py captcha_maker.py
```

## Usage
- Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
- A CAPTCHA image will be displayed on the page.
- Enter the text shown in the CAPTCHA image in the input field provided.
- Click the "Submit" button to verify the entered CAPTCHA text.
- A message will be displayed indicating whether the CAPTCHA was passed or failed.










## Used By

- Small Business Owners: Small businesses with websites that have forms (e.g., contact forms, signup forms) and need a simple solution to reduce spam submissions.
- Educational Institutions: Institutions that have online portals for student registration, feedback forms, or any kind of online submissions where ensuring the authenticity of the user is necessary.

- Beginner Python Developers: Individuals who are learning web development with Python and Flask and are looking for projects to understand how to create and integrate CAPTCHA functionality.

## Future scope:
- Adding more complex distortions and noise to the CAPTCHA image.
- Implementing different fonts and styles.
- Storing CAPTCHA images temporarily on the server and serving them via a URL instead of embedding them directly in the HTML.




##  Conclusion ðŸš€

CAPTCHA generator project demonstrates how to create a simple CAPTCHA system using Flask and the Python Imaging Library (PIL). The project generates a CAPTCHA image with random text, applies some basic distortions, and allows users to verify the CAPTCHA by entering the text.
